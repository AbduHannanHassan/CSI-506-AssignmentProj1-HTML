    <h2>=> Why Do Local Drives on Windows Start From C?</h2>
    <p>Back in time when floppies used to be the primary source of storage on computers instead of hard disks, the
        letters A and B were assigned to the first floppy disk and the second floppy disk, respectively.</p>
    <p>Similar to how the local drives are labeled today: C for the drive containing the OS, and consecutive letters
        referencing the drives that contain user data, the A drive (first floppy) was used to boot the PC and the B
        drive (second floppy) was for storing user data.</p>
    <p>Hard disk made its debut later on but didn't immediately render floppy disks obsolete. Instead of replacing
        floppies with hard disks on their computers, users started using both in conjunction. And as obvious, the next
        drive letter "C" got assigned to the additional storage disk, i.e., the hard disk.</p>
    <h2>=> Can You Use A and B Drives for Hard Disks?</h2>
    <p>If you still use floppy disks on your PC, you won't be able to use those labels. But that's highly unlikely that
        your computer has a floppy disk drive.

    </p>
    <p> modern computers, logical hard disk partitions don't get the label A and B by default, even if you use up all
        the available labels (up to Z). Windows users can manually change their local drive label to A and B, however,
        keep in mind that Windows doesn't index those drives as they were originally meant for removable disks like
        floppies.</p>
