        What is an Automatic Maintenance Schedule?</h1>

<h4>
As the name Maintenance suggests, windows runs a maintenance task in the system so as to keep the OS(Operating System), Programs or applications running within it updated. It also, checks for the malware in the system and other security-related issues. It is recommended to turn on the automatic maintenance schedule always in a system. The schedule to run this maintenance task is decided by the operating system such that there is minimal impact on the person using it and the system performance. It also, ensures that this task happens only when the system is plugged into the power ensuring the energy is utilized efficiently.
This maintenance task is run automatically by the system when it notices that the system is idle and is connected to the AC power. This task runs for a maximum of 1 hour in a session. If a user starts working when the maintenance task is running, that task is simply suspended. This task will then be resumed in the next maintenance session. By default, the system runs this task at 2:00 AM provided the system is idle and connected to the AC power. (This might differ from system to system)However, one can change this schedule and also opt to allow scheduled maintenance to wake up the PC at the scheduled time.
It is important to note that there are certain tasks that are marked as critical, These tasks won't be suspended when the user interrupts, these would still be running in the background till their completion. To avoid such a situation, one might want to schedule these maintenance tasks.
