    <h2>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</h2>
    <u><h3>PCI-e Wireless Adapters:</h3></u>
    <b>More Power, Less Flexibility</b><br>
    <em>
        <p>
            A <strong> PCI-e Wi-Fi network adapter</strong>, as you might expect, plugs into the PCI-e <em>(PCI
                Express)</em> port in your computer. If
            you're building your own PC, taking apart the case and locating this port on your motherboard should be
            pretty
            easy.
        </p>
    </em>
    <em>That said, some might not be comfortable doing this sort of work on their computer. It's not hard, but opening
        up your PC and working with electrostatically-sensitive parts can be a bit nerve-wracking.

        Once you've installed it, though, the PCI-e wireless adapter will give you more networking power. They typically
        pack at least two antennas, each of which will boost your Wi-Fi signal reception. Some of them, like the
        Rosewill RNX-AC1900PCE, even have three antennas, further increasing the card's potential for high-speed
        communication.

        Multiple antennas let a wireless card take advantage of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) spatial
        multiplexing... which is quite a mouthful and rather complicated. </em>

        <h3>USB Wireless Adapters:</h3>
    </u>
    <b>Less Power for Convenience   </b> <br><br>
    <i>A <b> USB Wi-Fi network adapter</b> is about as simple as it gets: you plug it into a USB port on your computer and connect your device to a Wi-Fi network. (Well, you might need to download some drivers and things first, but you get the idea.)</i><br>
    <i>And that's the single biggest advantage of using a USB Wi-Fi adapter. It's super easy to use, it only takes a few seconds to transfer it to a new computer, and you really can't screw up the installation. The adapter itself doesn't take up much space, and it's easy to use on a desktop or a laptop, whereas a PCI-e card will almost certainly be limited to a desktop.</i><br>
    <i>Unfortunately, the convenience of small size comes with some drawbacks. Because most USB wireless adapters don't pack any external antennae, they're less powerful. They likely won't get as strong reception as PCI-e cards, and many people report that they see lower speeds with USB adapters as well.</i>
